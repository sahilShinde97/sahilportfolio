# 🚀 Fixed Deployment Instructions

## ✅ Issue Resolved

The build error was caused by **case sensitivity issues** in import paths. This is common when deploying to Linux servers (like Vercel) which are case-sensitive, unlike Windows.

### Fixed Issues:
1. `./components/Navbar` → `./components/NavBar`
2. `../components/models/contact/ContactExperience` → `../components/Models/contact/ContactExperience`
3. `../components/Models/TechLogos/Techicon.jsx` → `../components/Models/TechLogos/TechIcon.jsx`
